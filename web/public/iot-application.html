            IoT Apps
          </h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            IoT (Internet of Things) apps are applications that enable
            communication between devices and the internet. These apps are used
            to connect various physical devices and sensors to the internet and
            enable them to communicate with each other. The primary function of
            IoT apps is to collect data from these devices and sensors, analyze
            it, and perform actions based on the data collected.

            Smart Building
          </h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            A smart building is a building that uses advanced technologies, such
            as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and data
            analytics to optimize its operations and enhance the experience of
            its occupants. Smart buildings are designed to be more efficient,
            sustainable, and comfortable than traditional buildings, while also
            improving safety and security.

            Control Interface
          </h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            A control interface is a system or device that allows a user to
            interact with and control another system or device. It provides a
            means for users to send commands and receive feedback from the
            system or device they are controlling. The control interface can
            take many forms, including physical switches, buttons, knobs, touch
            screens, voice recognition, and gesture control.
